<br>
In this repository there are some files needed to train a neural network for object detection that exploits the Tensorflow API.
<ol>
  <li>get your custom dataset
  <li>upload it to <i><a href="roboflow.com">roboflow.com</a></i>
  <li>open COLAB notebook <b>MobileNet_ssd_Object_Detection.ipynb</b>
  <li>follow the instructions
  <li>enjoy
</ol>
<br>
At the end of the execution you will have obtained a TFLite model to use in your mobile application.
